# Projects
SpotifyDB - Database project inspired by Spotify's database system in which I was tasked with the creation of a database and bulk inserting data into the created tables. Includes a view, a user-defined function, and a 
BoomboxDB - Hypothetical speaker and headphone hardware company for which I built a database, formed tables, and constructed queries to view that data. Includes common tables such as Customer, Product, and Order. Demonstrates my knowledge of relational databases and querying data.
